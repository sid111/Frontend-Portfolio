# Portfolio

This project is a multi-page portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It
features four pages: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The Home page includes an
autoplay image slider, the Projects page showcases nine featured projects in a responsive
grid, and the Contact page contains a working form with social links. The site employs a
dark gradient theme with teal accents and is designed to be responsive across devices.

## Technical Details

• HTML: Semantic structure with <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> elements. The Home page utilizes slides with background images, the Projects page displays a 3×3 responsive grid of project cards, and the Contact page includes a form and social icons.

• CSS: Centralized styling in style.css with dark gradient backgrounds and teal highlights. Responsive layout achieved using CSS Grid and media queries. Buttons, cards, and form elements are styled with hover effects.

• JavaScript: The script.js file handles slider autoplay, navigation controls, and contact form validation. No external JavaScript frameworks are used, ensuring a lightweight and portable design.

## Challenges & Solutions

• Slider Autoplay and Smooth Transition: Implemented class toggling and
JavaScript timers to achieve smooth transitions and autoplay functionality.

• Responsive Grid Layout: Defined explicit breakpoints to ensure the project grid
adapts to various screen sizes, maintaining readability and usability.

• Theme Consistency: Centralized colors and styles in the CSS file to maintain a
consistent dark theme with teal accents across all pages.

• Missing Assets During Testing: Added placeholder images and fallback styles to
prevent layout issues when assets are temporarily unavailable
